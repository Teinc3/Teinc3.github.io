## Reading List
*Last Updated: March 8, 2024*

I haven't read any book for like 3 years ever since high school kicked in,
but recently I find social/political genres resourceful and interesting, so that's where I'm at right now.

### Currently Reading
#### "How to win every argument" by Mehdi Hasan

I was prompted this question before: *"What's the point of life?"*

There's a reason why people want to get rich and have power.
It's the nature of humans to exhibit dominance and control over others, attracting partners for mating and future offspring.

And to do the former effectively, you need to be able to win arguments.

I'm not good at verbal reasoning, but in this day and age, it's a skill that's necessary to have.

*P.S. Oxford Union seems awesome, might check it out in the future.*

### Completed
#### The Thomas Sowell Reader
Completed on March 6, 2024

Very based work in my opinion, when you realize that most of the "problems" in society are artificial constructs distracting you from the truthful reality.

Will probably look into more of his works in the future

### Plan to Read

#### Rich Dad Poor Dad
I'm probably financially illiterate, and I think this book will help me understand the basics of it.

#### In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America's Best-Run Companies
Will help with management and leadership skills that I need to develop in the future if I were to make a startup myself.
