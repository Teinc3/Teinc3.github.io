## Daily Agenda
*Date: March 13, 2024*

This is written during midnight, so I know what I have to do when I wake up. I hope I can follow through with this.

BTW, ear canals are getting oily again, this is painful, when you use ultra thin cotton buds but don't actually soak anything out, smh I hate it

### Self-improvement

1. Continue [reading](/books)
   - Haven't been reading for the past few days, hopefully I can get back to it immediately.
   - I'm starting to have an interest in economic theory, even though I basically know nothing about it.

2. Electronics
   - Search amazon for Wifi and bluetooth arduino modules
   - Then build a web app that can control the arduino
   - Also maybe get some transistors as well since I want to make a full-bit adder

3. Exercise
   - Continue my exercising adventure...

4. Music
   - I recently found that AI could help me a ton with music, particularly by stemming tracks into individual instruments
   - Helps me understand how composition works
   - I'll look into some more examples for now and try something with my DAW

5. Writing blogs
   - M2 Polygon guide for ProTanki
   - My experience with coding (starting 8 years ago)
   - My views on societal politics

### Games

1. ProTanki
   - ProTanki event has ended so I cannot spend so much time on polygons again
   - Probably max 1 polygon game on each account per day but that still takes up 3 hours total...
   - Maybe I just don't play on my mini and only main (for games with wristrock and Gaius) and my 3 Diamond alt
   - I might also make a blog on M2 Polygons because imo the constant victories vs tryhards make me feel like its more fun than playing with M3s

2. Fulltilt Pinball Space Cadet
   - Max 1 hour per day
   - This game has shit rng anyways, its not like I won't rage quit from the ball constantly draining or the table tilting out of thin air xd
