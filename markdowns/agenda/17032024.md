## Daily Agenda
*Date: March 17, 2024*

I'm writing this through **GitJournal** rn, for the first few minutes everything was weird (I couldn't change filenames nor save them), I hope I configured it correctly though.

Also I'm a little sick but I have no idea why I am still not sleeping as of now (6am soon)

1. Order stuff on Amazon as I don't trust the quality of Chi products 
   - Bluetooth board (BLE, slave, 3-5V)
   - WiFi board, have not looked into the specifics
   - Some herbal supplements 
   - Should be enough for free shipping, hopefully they come in a batch

2. Music
   - Continue transcribing *Valse de Paris* to midi format (Bonk.io menu OST 2)
   - Test some synths on Analog Lab V (or another VST, if I find any)

3.
