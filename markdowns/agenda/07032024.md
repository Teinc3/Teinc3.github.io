## Daily Agenda
*Date: March 7, 2024*

Daily reminder to stop slackening off.

1. Continue work on this website
   - Write a Markdown to HTML Parser
   - Modularizing the existing home page contents into multiple articles/blogs


2. Evoku
   - Main menu UI Update


3. Play ProTanki
   - Get First Lieutenant (or a few xp away from it) on my alt


4. Maybe I will make an IG and Snapchat account 
   - This will help distinguish myself from Chinese people when I go abroad in the future
   - Chinese people only socialize with themselves, and they only use Chinese apps (Which we don't use here in HK)
   - My old IG account got banned for suspicious activity (?), so I need to make a new one


5. Continue my [reading list](./books)
