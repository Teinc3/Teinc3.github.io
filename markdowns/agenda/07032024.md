## Daily Agenda
*Date: March 7, 2024*

Daily reminder to <abbr title="Not copying Ben">stop slackening off</abbr>.

1. Continue work on this website
   - Write a Markdown to HTML Parser (Update: I'm lazy and just used showdown.js for this one)
   - Modularizing the existing home page contents into multiple articles/blogs


2. Evoku
   - Main menu UI Update


3. Anti-Antisocial measures
   - My old IG account got banned for suspicious activity (?), so I need to make a new one
   - Don't like it but I guess it's necessary if you want to find friends (At least it gives less brain damage than tiktok)


4. Continue work on my [reading list](/books)
