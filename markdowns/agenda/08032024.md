## Daily Agenda
*Date: March 8, 2024*

1. Finish the website parsers
   - I'm almost done with them, just need to fix a few bugs


2. Protanki farming
   - Apparently this festivity has double funds and 3x golds, time to farm madness tdm and get like 50k an hour


3. Continue work on my [reading list](/books)
   - I will admit that I've been slacking off on this one, but I'm going to get back to it


4. Evoku style polishing
   - Add icon buttons to leaderboard, account, and social media panels
   - I'll take a look at tailwind to see if it can help, provided that I have time remaining for today
