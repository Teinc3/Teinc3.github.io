## Why I hope Kamala Harris wins the 2024 US Presidential Election

Tomorrow is finally the day we've been waiting so long for, the day of the 2024 US Presidential Election.
Donald Trump is now trying on his 3rd attempt to win the election, and standing up against him is Kamala Harris.
But maybe now it's the time to retire this soon-to-be 80 year old convicted felon and let the first Black-(Indian?)-Female President take the stage.

Ppersonally, I have nothing against Donald trump, and I even think he was a president that has, to some degree, done good to the country.
There is obviously a lot of negative news coverage about him by the mainstream media, which may skew the public's perception of him.
In fact, I do even have sympathies for him, as the Hunter Biden laptop story was censored massively by the FBI and could definitely have altered the outcome of the 2020 election,
if we assume that the January 6th events wouldn't have happened with a Trump victory.

If I were a US citizen, I would probably vote for Trump, as it is between the lesser of two evils, and a Trump presidency would probably improve the living standards of most Americans.
However, as a foreigner, I have vastly different perspectives on the election, and I hope Kamala Harris wins the election.

Firstly, Kamala Harris is grossly incompetent as a leader and for the last 4 years has virtually no accomplishments to show for.
By judging on her current performance, I am confident that a 25-29 Kamala presidency will push the US towards the brink of collapse.
This is when most of the populace will finally wake up to the fact that overt government bureaucracy, censorship and corruption is not the way to go,
and that the US needs to return to its roots of personal freedom, individualism and liberty.
With most of the neo-conservative big-government republicans defecting over to the Democrats,
Libertarianism will have a much greater chance of taking over the GOP, 
fielding a strong and effective candidate who will most likely win the election by a landslide, and altering the course of the US for the better and for much longer to come.

I also believe that economic progress fundamentally comes with cycles of growth and recession, so by letting Kamala Harris win the election and the US economy collapse to its fullest, 
economic growth will start to recover strongly after a GOP victory in 28, and that corresponds to the time when I graduate university and start to heavily invest myself in the job sector, 
which is basically tied to the performance of the US economy.

Trump has leaned libertarian on some issues, especially after witnessing himself getting screwed over by the DOJ and FBI.
However, he is ultimately still an executive power person, and his presidency will only delay the inevitable collapse of the US economy, making a full Libertarian takeover of the country much harder to achieve.
Weighing the pros and cons, Trump needs to step aside for Harris to bear the brunt of what she helped caused during the last 4 years.

Call me selfish hoping for the downfall of a nation, and I won't object to your criticism at all. Again, a person living in a mansion will never understand the sufferings of war. 
So why not let them eat cake, and suffer the consequences of their actions?
