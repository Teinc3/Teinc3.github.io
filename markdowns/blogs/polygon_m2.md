## Guide to M2 Polygon
*Last updated: 13/03/2024*
*Genre: ProTanki*

When my ProTanki alt **Teinc3** got to <abbr title="First Lieutenant">3 diamonds</abbr>,
I quickly purchased the kits Fortress and Boar.
I wrote this [guide](https://wiki.playprotanki.com/en/An_Analysis_on_Kit_Progression) earlier
on how to get the most out of kit purchases before, so I kinda know what I was doing since day 1.

I immediately started playing Polygons because now with the 2 best M2 turrets and paints in the game, 
I was practically invincible in Polygon.
You could also make the point that other maps such as Dusseldorf DM are just plain boring and slow to rank up,
and without Viking M2 you're at a disadvantage in maps like Island (Dictator is simply too clumsy, change my mind)

I was literally #1 in my team every game and our team had a win rate of around 85%.
So you could say that I was pretty much the best M2 polygon player at the time.
There really is no secret to it, Rico and Thunder M2 are really that strong.

### Dealing with Protection Paints
Sure, Spark and Rustle do set you back a bit with 42% and 40% protection respectively,
but instruct your thunders to target sparks and your ricos to target rustles and your team will still control the game.

Usually people with spark have Rico and Titan so the thunders are advised to take some rico protection,
so that they don't get wiped out by the Ricos so easily.
Thunders usually do hit-and-run tactics so the slow Ricos can't really catch up to them.
They usually die before they can reach the center of the map.

The interesting thing is that Clay is really the ultimate counter to both of them,
but it is only available at M3 (when you buy Northerner which also gives you Smoky M3).
So by setting your rank range to only M2, you can avoid the Clay problem altogether.
Besides, Smoky M3 is just on another level, 
so Northerner users don't really get an advantage in these games,
especially if they get targeted by Hail kit users with the better Needle paint.

### The ideal lineup
I created an ideal combination for M2 Polygons yesterday, and I think it will absolutely dominate the game.

- Tunnel Group:
  - Isida, Viking, Spark (Healer)
  - Hammer, Mammoth, Premium (Defender)

- Frontal Group:
  - Twins, Viking, Rustle
  - Freeze, Viking, Atom

- Control Group:
  - Rico, Mammoth, Spark
  - Rico, Mammoth, Urban

- Camping Group (Damage Control):
  - Thunder, Dictator, Hohloma (Near the bridge above the void)
  - Thunder, Mammoth, Sandstone (Beneath the bridge over the cliff)

And here is my reasoning:

#### Tunnel Group
The Tunnel Group will cover the center of the map at all times, and when enemy attacks die down it will recapture the point.
Enemies usually try to overwhelm the defender but neglect approaching frontal groups.
The defender should attempt to soak up as much damage as possible, but when heavily damaged should retreat into the tunnel.
It is important that the defender does not die. Otherwise the tunnel will become undefended for a long time (Mammoth moves very slow!)
After retreating the Frontal and Control groups will sweep up the remaining enemies.

The choice of Hammer is to counter enemy Freezes/Fires which usually have weaker hulls and have paints that do not protect against Hammer.
Good hammer protection is only found in Rhino and Atom - which do not protect against Ricos and Thunder.
This allows the Control and Camping groups to destroy them easily.
Its strong recoil can also flip enemy tanks attacking from the tunnel entrance.

Mammoth blocks melee enemies from entering the tunnel and damaging the Isida.
The healer equips Spark so that enemy Ricos cannot damage the Isida effectively through bouncing their shots.

#### Frontal Group
The Frontal Group assists the Tunnel Group by attacking enemies that are currently busy attacking the Tunnel defender.
They can also assist the Control group in clearing out enemy camping groups if the point is not being attacked.

Frontal Groups usually have medium hulls and can move quickly to the center of the map and help hold the point from enemies.
They do not need more armor because they are not the main targets of enemy attacks - the Tunnel Group is.

Freeze is also highly effective in slowing down enemy tanks (e.g. Ram) and preventing them from approaching the center.
At the center, it should gain a good position to simultaneously damage multiple enemies using its cone of splash damage.
Whenever the Tunnel defender retreats, the attackers should have been frozen and fail to respond to the frontal group.
Then, together with the defender, they recapture the point.

Twins is much suited on Viking M2 than on Mammoth M2 (Titan M2 is a joke, but M3 is another story)
because of its relatively lower range and stability.
A twins user may want to equip spark protection instead if they find themselves consistently targeted by enemy Ricos.

#### Control Group
The Control Group destroys enemy camping groups and tunnel groups (if any), and weakens enemy frontal groups.

Ricochets have high damage output and decent range, and they can target the enemy Frontal Group from a distance.
Shots do not need to be accurately aimed at the center of the map, because of the bouncing effect.
Vikings have less health and can be taken down even if Spark is equipped,
with some help from either the Camping or Tunnel Group.

Control group mammoths do not need to go to the center of the map.
Instead, they can strategically position themselves near choke points to block enemy tanks from reaching the center.
They can also provoke fights with enemy frontal groups to distract them from attacking the center.

If an enemy tunnel group is being set up, the control group should focus the Isida if it does not have Spark protection.
Aim at the sides of the tunnel and the projectiles will bounce off the walls and hit the Isida.
Otherwise, try to concentrate all shots on the defender.
If the defender retreats, use the bouncing effect to deal the final blow.

Control group ricos should try to block enemy campers with their hulls or knock off their aim,
so that they cannot threaten the frontal group when they are busy defending from a swarm attack.
This also deals damage to enemy campers, unless they have rustle, which is usally rare.

#### Camping Group
The camping group uses splash damage to weaken and destroy overwhelming point pushes by the enemy.
Usually, an overwhelming point push involves around 3 or more enemy tanks clustering at the center.
These pushes are very vulnerable to thunder's splash damage,
and so the thunders should try to splash every enemy at the center.
With 2 thunders, all enemies can be neutralized in around 2-3 shot cycles.

Thunders may act as a less-effective control group targeting individual enemies if the point is not being attacked,
but it must redirect its shots towards the center whenever an attack is commencing there.

The thunder near the bridge above the void should be equipped with Hohloma.
Freezes approaching and enemy ricos shooting from the center don't deal too much damage.
The choice of Dictator rather than Viking is because of its higher height,
which allows it to rock its hull and shoot down at the entrance of the tunnel.
This can assist the defender in cleaning up enemy frontal groups aiming at the tunnel.

### Smart moves
- There is no need to attack an enemy mammoth if it is not close to the center of the map and if you can prioritize other targets.
- Prioritize staying alive as the defender. You're slow and it takes a long time to get back to the tunnel. The Isida has viking, and can always come back quickly.
- Coordinate with your teammates when swapping paints. Do not all swap at the same time.
