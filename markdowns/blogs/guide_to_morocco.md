### Before you enter
1. Use AVITO.ma to find cheap and traditional housing in Morocco. A room (studio) will be around 150-200 MAD per night, any less its probably fake listings, any more just do AirBNB. You can mostly contact the hosts through Whatsapp, no need to message them on the platform. If you don't know French just use ChatGPT to translate to either french or darija arabic. Just note that the location may be pretty far away from city centre

2. Register a money transfer account (I used Western Union) and exchange when the rate gets favourable. Physical exchange rates in Morocco are quite ass from the mid market rate, let WU do it for you. You will find many cash agents across cities, so no need to worry about you not getting the sum

### When you enter
3. Download stuff such as Indrive (Safe Uber-like app) and google map of the city using airport wifi as you will not have data if you don't get one of the data plans offered at the airport (usually slightly worse)

4. If your airport does not have WU then you will be forced to exchange money at a very unfavorable rate. Don't worry because we only have to exchange around 50-100 MAD so that we can ride Indrive/bus to city center, grab our cash, get a data plan and proceed to accommodation. 

5. Grab free SIMs at the airport if possible and compare plans. Normal price is 10GB is around 50 MAD, anything above that is a scam. If you don't grab a free SIM you will be forced to pay 30 MAD for one in the city centre (which I had to do, oops)

### Transportation
6. Specify "English Only" in ride options for InDrive if you can't speak French so they don't try to call you in French (and everything gets confusing quick)

7. Set your pickup location a bit further from where you are if there are taxi stands nearby. Taxis don't like Indrive and will try to create unnecessary drama.

8. You can mostly get away with setting the minimum fare but if nobody responds you can increment it slightly.

9. Buses are now 5 MAD thanks to inflation (I witnessed the change from 24-25) so a single coin now works. ~~Some routes were 3.5 before but since nobody cares about the .5 everyone just pays 4. Or maybe the less well-off cares about the .5 but its not your business.~~

10. First class trains are worth it. For coaches always purchase tickets in a major station even though its slightly pricier, it is more safer thanks to ONCF.

11. Bus schedules on google maps are not reliable and are only for reference. It can range from being 4 minutes early to complete noshows. ONCF train schedules are mostly reliable.

### Food
12. Only enter a restaurant if it has a menu. Not all show them outside but you can check if they have any on google maps. 

13. Clarify if the extra food they send you is included or not (it usually is, don't worry too much).

14. You can easily translate any menu with ChatGPT or Google Translate. You can prompt Chat for more info such as price ranges even though it is not that helpful.

15. Price Reference: Couscous and Tagine 30-50, Sandwiches 15-25, Tacos 25-30, Juices 10-15, Tea/Soup 5-10 etc. Some may have fries included.

16. Morocco is a night country so you can still find a lot of food options at 12am.

### Sightseeing
17. There may be hidden student discounts (but don't bother with Youth Card if required).

18. Some places are closed on Fridays to Sundays (Friday is Islamic rest day, Sunday is official rest day)

19. Do not accept anything from strangers. So no horse/camel rides, etc. Just say no or speak another language they don't understand, they will give up eventually. Same thing works with beggars.

20. No need to dump your time on Casa, Rabat is way cleaner, more modern and less busy. Tanger city is not worth, do max 2 days near the beaches (AVOID THE DECOMPOSING KELP THEY SMELL LIKE ASS). Marrakesh is just the usual touristy spots. Fes, mekniz and chefchaouen look pretty decent, too bad i'm not in the cultural mood to visit them.

21. Medinas are basically glorified slums, but if you have experience with wet markets (perhaps living just above one, typical HK experience) you will be fine

### Miscellaneous
22. Violent crime is not an issue, but be careful of pickpockets so I suggest using a waistbag and constantly putting your hand in your trouser pocket containing your phone. Also look around at night and walk faster if you see someone suspicious following you. If the situation gets bad call *19* or the tourist police (they speak good english)

23. Cash is king, plus you don't have a card with MAD so you have no choice anyways

24. Food/Grocery prices can feel very expensive or very cheap at the same time thanks to how things are imported. EU prices in morocco don't make sense but is the unfortunate reality.

25. Either bring a powerbank, or memorize large avenues within the city map and navigate through them (I did the 2nd part once, pretty fun)

26. Google maps ratings might be deceiving sometimes. Always read what the 1 star reviews say first. If they have a legit issue you are concerned with then you can always go to another place.

27. Know your currency. HKD = 5/4 MAD, USD/EUR = 10 MAD, GBP = 12.5 MAD
