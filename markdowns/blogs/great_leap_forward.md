## The Great Leap Forward

Some radical plans to transform me from being a useless idiot into a more useful idiot.
Yes, I know radical plans tend to not work, so I'm doing them slowly and gradually.
Also this is just a general outline, I will have to adapt to the specifics of the situation.

### Social Aspect
Improve social skills by talking to people more often. Avoid segregating into groups of same hobbies and interests - talk to more people on a variety of different issues. Maybe even go to the pub regularly, first with friends, then alone.

I also want to learn beatboxing so I could join some music group.

Might also join the Oxford Union and attend debates. Don't think I have the guts to speak in front of a crowd yet, so we can start with small conversations. I also don't wanna get cancelled that quickly as I have slight libertarian and even conservative views (although not by much). If only DEI extended to inclusivity of viewpoints it would be great.

### Physical Abilities
Climate should be relatively smooth sail so I could do a bit more with jogging. Swimming can be done twice a week or so. Strength training can be done every other day if I have time. Maybe even Orienteering since fields and forests are plentiful here.

I've been skipping breakfast since I wake up kinda late into the day, but since lectures seem to start early, I will take the opportunity to have a cup of tea or coffee. Also good to have an opportunity to talk with friends when everyone is still sleepy, so you get more relaxed conversations.

Might take a look at this varsity trip skiing thing and see if any people in my college are interested. But I'll probably only join next year because i just can't get to know that many friends that will ball with me in only 2 months.

### Academic Aspect
I should probably work around 5-6 hours a day. Uninstalling games on my laptop should help.

Might start tutoring people in physics, maybe maths but not as confident. Maybe I could help with UCAS apps as well.

For summers I will have to start finding internships. Luckily engineers have a much broader field of internships than CS nerds so I could do chips, software, or even finance. 

### Financial Aspect
Plan is to get around 300 quid a month from tutoring which is a relatively good amount for a part-time job.

I could also find some coding jobs from the engineering department since its pretty large. The CS department is probably too theoretical for such jobs.

I could also work in a pub or a coffee shop and gain some social skills but the pay is relatively shit, so that's a backup plan.

Finally I should start learning investing, some basic economic theory (which I am currently catching up to). My dad recommends I do CFA, but that's probably only after I finish my 3rd year.
