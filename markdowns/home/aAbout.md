'05 Hongkonger that is equally bad at everything

Currently studying Applied AI at HKU but planning to leave, because STEM people have no future here.
I wish to create a startup, but have no idea what it will be about.
Maybe sth related to AI since it's pretty fire recently.
Creativity is the only path forward in a world where everything is automated anyways.

Have an interest in most things but can't actually be competent in any of them

I have preferred pronouns (<abbr title="Honestly who cares about pronouns these days smh"><span id="aUnderlineTooltip1">hokzar/poorjar</span></abbr>)

Also, I hate nerds and I am not a nerd. People who think I am a nerd are the nerdiest of the nerds <b>:CHECKMATE:</b>
