# About Me

## Introduction
Hi there! You may have stumbled upon this page by random luck, or you may have stalked me here. Either way, welcome to my website!
At the time of writing, I'm 18 years old from Hong Kong, but I plan to study abroad in the future. On the Internet, I am typically known by my aliases Teinc3 or Vkij.

There is a common misconception that I am a nerd. I'd like to clarify that I am not one and in fact I hate nerds. I would describe myself as more of a poorjar, or a noob person, whatever you call it.

## My website
I built this site using React and Chakra UI as a learning experience. The source code is available on my [Github](https://github.com/Teinc3/teinc3.github.io) for your reference.

## Games and communities
I love to play strategy games and get the most out of them, and I might join dedicated game communities if I like the game enough.

Here are some game communities where I am active in:

### [Territorial.io](https://territorial.io)
A minimalistic multiplayer game where you conquer the world by capturing territories from other players and bots.

I was previously the top 1v1 player and the sole admin of the game's Discord server. I have extensive connections with the creator of the game, and I will be working as a freelancer for his third project soon.

I had reverse-engineered the game's source code entirely and learnt JavaScript from scratch. I experimented with machine learning using spawn-picking scenarios and I also assisted in the development of a micro algorithm which is unbeatable by any human player.

### [Protanki](https://playprotanki.com/en)
Basically an old, recreated version of Tanki Online based on the 2014 version.

I am responsible for updating the english wiki there. You can find my profile [here](https://wiki.playprotanki.com/en/User:Dguyj).

## Affiliations
I am currently a part of Oxtroza Studios together with oi, and we are currently working on a game called [Evoku](https://evoku.me) which reinvigorates Sudoku into a competitive multiplayer experiences. We are currently looking for a third member who is good at art and design to join our team.

## Interests
I'm interested in a wide variety of topics and I love exploring and learning new things. These are currently my plans on what I want to do in the future.

### Technical

#### Code
I dislike Computer science as a subject and to a lesser extent software engineering as I'm more interested in the practical side of code. However I still enjoy coding for my personal projects.

I hope to learn the following:

- Proper Web development skills
 - Settle with a JS Framework (Most likely React or Next)
 - Learn CSS properly
 - TS for backend
- C for Hardware
- Python for Deep learning and AI models

#### Engineering
- Assemble a drone from scratch
 - GPS chips for Navigation
 - Image Recognition camera to avoid collisions
 - Gyroscope for load balancing
- Improve my previous projects
 - Refactor my smart home integration app to increase compatibility
- Feel free to suggest more project ideas to me!

### Arts

#### Languages
I currently speak 2/3 languages, namely Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin) and English. However, I want to learn more in the future as I find language learning intuitive and meaningful. I am currently interested in the following ones:

- A Slavic Language
 - Probably Russian because it's the most used slavic language
- An Iberian language
 - Either Spanish or Portuguese

#### Music
I'm Asian myself and I always believe that Classical Music is completely unrelated to us. That's why I'm interested more in modern genres where our generation is more involved in. This includes:

- Beatboxing
 - Vocal percussion
- Music Composition
 - Electronic/EDM genre
 - How to use composition studio software properly
 - How to pick a proper sound library

### Personal

#### Sports
I like to see for myself places where I have never been to, culminating in my preference for outdoor sports as I am allowed to freely explore my surroundings.

Some of my favorite sports include:

- Cross-country Running
- Orienteering (Outside of Hong Kong)
- Skiing (Only in Winter)

#### Travel
These are the places I want to visit in the future:

- Asia
 - Malaysia and Singapore for overseas Chinese culture
 - Vietnam for food
 - Perhaps India but only when their sanitation improves
- Europe
 - Switzerland/Austria/Italy for Alps, I love Skiing
 - Germany or France for small towns and architecture
 - Poland or Russia for absolutely no reason
 - Spain/Portugal for history related to the age of discovery
- Middle East
 - Turkey for food and people
 - Iran for culture
 - Israel and Palestine to understand the ongoing conflict better from a first-hand perspective
- Latin America
 - Mexico for Mayan history
 - Peru for Incan history
 - Brazil for their hybrid culture

#### Miscellaneous
- Train myself a female extra voice to catfish virgins online (Would be pretty fun ngl)
