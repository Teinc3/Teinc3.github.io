# Revisiting Infectonator

Infectonator is such a classic game. I remember playing it like 10 years ago, and I can still recall many intricate details in it (Hello Ill Kim Jongs). But what puzzles me the most is how there hasn't already been a documented strategy on how to play the game strategically on the web. When I returned to the game just for the sake of nostalgia, I was quickly hooked up and devised some strategies on how to play it optimally.

## Coin Farming

Infectonator requires coins to upgrade the firepower statistics of your zombie arsenal. Of course, you can use Game Guardian to modify the number of coins you have, or you could have used Lucky Patcher and unlocked all In-App Purchases. But everyone would agree that it's kind of self-defeating. If you want every single zombie to be *Godmode_ON*, why not do it the **Legal** way?

### Map Choice

Simply go to **National Park**, the place in the Canada region, where there are like 216 peeps there. If you accidentally destroyed National Park and couldn't access it anymore, then **Rio de Janeiro** or **Ottawa** are good choices as well, but infections take longer to end there, so the rate of coin yield is lower. Remember not to complete any specific objectives, such as placing specific zombie squads not in your combat force normally or using supplies to kill people. I haven't experimented that much with the Santa maps, but theoretically, the high population density combined with penetration would give an insane coin yield rate. Just remember not to pick a map with heroes; otherwise, it's going to take longer to wipe out the entire elf population.

Now I kinda think that the larger a city is in real life, the fewer people it has in the game, and vice versa.

### Equipment

Make sure that you have zombie stats leveled up to the max and around 30 for damage resistance and attack; otherwise, you're gonna have a hard time without micromanagement. Try to unlock both **Zombie Penetration** and **Wall Penetration** because National Park has a lot of randomly scattered trees which may obstruct your viruses. Obviously, take all levels of **Coin Magnet**, **Virus Count**, and **Spread Directions**. For zombie squads, equip **Kruggy** for speed boosts, **Jayson** for health boosts, and the 2 Goo-spitting zombies because you want goo everywhere to reinforce against localized pockets of resistance. **Coin Collectors** are useless because they often die too early and can't keep up with the pace of the game.

### Process

After that, what you do is simple and repetitive at best: Set the speed to X2, drop all 3 viruses at scattered positions, then drop all 4 squads immediately afterward. It is a good idea to arrange the order of your zombie squads so that you can place them down as streamlined as possible. There is a small and narrow corridor at the top right of the map which is perfect for Goo-trapping by Puker, as even if resistance overwhelms your zombies, they'll be forced to step on the Goo blocking the corridor, and either die or get infected.

After you finish placing down everything, alternate between your left and right thumbs to swipe through a portion of the side on the screen, preferably from the screen edges to the center. If you're using a tablet, good luck with collecting all the coins.

Listen to the sounds - when you hear that gunshot sounds have died down, then most likely your zombies have wiped out the map. Swipe the screen a few times, then you'll be directed to the news-reporter page where you can press **Try Again**. Repeat everything I just wrote down, and you have a coin farm strategy for the game.

## Dealing with Heroes

Heroes are hard to deal with because of their massive HP and insane splash damage dealt to your zombies. For every hero with the exception of the Toge Reporters, you can simply overwhelm heroes with high Zombie resistance, attack, and 2-3 high-level zombie squads (Such as Jayson which increases resistance).

The situation in **Toge Office** changes, however, as the heroes are insanely overpowered. However, there is obviously an easy workaround to this. Stock up 10 traps and try to bait the reporters into grouping up in the narrow corridor at the right side of the map. Then, place down traps exactly where the heroes are - With 50 traps dealing splash damage to all of the reporters, it's basically overkill. Now you don't have to worry about them massacring your zombies with rocket launchers.

## Completing Support Missions

When you have a strong zombie army that can wipe out an entire map by its own, there is no point in using supports actively; however, this is an objective required by the game in many maps and frankly is annoying. You might come across maps where you have to kill a whopping 30 people with support, but the secret formula to that is really basic - just use traps.

You kill around 5 people with traps, sometimes more and sometimes less but the number stays consistent. Just buy 6 traps and possibly 1-2 grenades for backup, then place them down near clusters of Population. You don't have to worry about Secret agents not

 dying to them, as traps have splash damage and most likely the Agent will step on another mine triggering his ultimate death.

Killing people with grenades is a lot harder than using traps, goo, or canister bombs. But you can always use bacon to group clusters of population together for one single hit. If you play without using bacon, try to assume that each grenade will give you 2 kills. Always attempt to target 2 civilians or more at a time, as grenades are too weak to kill weaponized people in 1 or 2 tries.

Just note that after killing a substantial portion of the starting population with support you put yourself in a dangerous situation where everyone is either a Hazelnut or Secret agent and you can't really infect anyone, so your zombies get gunned down. It's typically better to restart your game if this happens.

## Memory Editing

Infectonator is a single-player game and so is easy to perform memory editing on. You could always change the speed of each zombie to a very high number, but it's not too useful as each zombie has a limited sight range so what happens is they only zoom around their local area at lightning speed but remain idle. It's also possible to set your zombie resistance to an absurdly high value, but then overflow might occur and your zombies get one-tapped by police officers.

The fun really comes when you try to edit the level in Endless mode to a very high number. Firstly what you notice is that it takes a lengthy time to enter the map, and the loading time scales with the level number, so setting it too high will only shoot you in the ankle. Even after you load the map you'll realize that there aren't initially as many people on the map as you thought there would be. Infectonator loads new people as soon as the pre-existing ones die or turn to zombies. The number of people simultaneously present on each map is always going to stay around the same regardless of the total amount of people you have to infect to kill off the map. The only thing that might happen is that the game fails to render that many dead zombies and human corpses and crashes on its own.
